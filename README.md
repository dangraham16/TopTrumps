Interactive Top Trumps Game

Project Title - Top Trumps Game

Motivation - A fun way to practice and demonstrate recently acquired JavaScript skills, as well as building on HTML and CSS.

About:
Attempting to develop a functioning local two-player top trumps style game. To initiate a game click the 'START' button. This will randomly assign cards to each player and reveal the first card of player 1, who must take the first turn. The player should decide which category they think will be higher than their opponent and click the category title. After clicking the category, the opponents card will be revealed. The winning card will be enlarged on the screen, and the losing card made smaller to demonstrate which won. The losing card will then be added to the deck of the winning player, and the 'remaining cards' tally updated to reflect this. This process continues until a player has 0 cards remaining, when the 'currently winning' box will be updated with the player number who has won the most games. If the user would like to keep playing, then clicking the 'PLAY AGAIN' button will reshuffle the cards and restart the game.

Planned Updates/Additions:
* Currently the game is not responsive, so the next versions will be updated to include mobile/small-screen viewing.
* A landing page will be added to introduce the website.
* Additional cards need to be added to the Car's deck.
* Additional genre's will be added to give the user a choice of deck, which will be selectable on the landing page.
